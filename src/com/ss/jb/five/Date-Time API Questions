1. LocalDateTime class would work well. ZoneDateTime class might be good for different time zones. These classes
both track time down to the nanosecond.
2. Using a TemporalAdjustor, the previous method can then be used to find the previous date
3. Both of these classes track offsets from UTC time, but ZoneOffset only tracks absolute offset from UTC while
ZoneID can also find how the offset changes due to time of year or region.
4. Instant to a ZonedDateTime: use the ZonedDateTime.ofInstant method
    ZonedDateTime to Instant: use the Instant.atZone method
